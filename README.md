## Content Management (Sanity)

This project uses Sanity for managing blog posts and stories. The schema definitions are located in `sanity/schemaTypes`.

To manage content, you can either:
-   Access the deployed Sanity Studio (if available).
-   Run the sanity studio locally (check the `sanity/` folder for specific scripts if a separate package.json exists there, otherwise managed via the main app if configured).
